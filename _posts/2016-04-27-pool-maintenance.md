Last year we did major work on the deck surrounding the swimming pool. This led to a revision of our drain line replacement schedule.

I thought we would not need to close the pool for maintenance this year, but Maintenance has informed me that we need to do some work on the pool's coping stones. This will require us to close the pool for a week.

We plan to close the pool from May 9 to May 14\. The pool work will not affect the drain line schedule; we expect to start work on the Tower 1, 13-stack of units on May 5\.
