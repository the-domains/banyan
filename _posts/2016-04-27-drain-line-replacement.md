We are nearly finished with the Tower 2, 13-stack drain line replacement. After the T2 13-stack is finished, we will move to the 13-stack in Tower 1\.

In addition to the unit drain lines, we are replacing sections of laundry room drains. These drain lines, especially in Tower 1, are subject to blockage from the volume of water discharged by our washing machines. We are adding cleanouts as we work on these pipes, which will make maintenance easier and should allow us to keep the lines clear without having to replace them frequently.
