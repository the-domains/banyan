_The Association does not rent apartments._ The Association of Apartment Owners (AOAO) manages Waikiki Banyan's common elements but we are not realtors and we have no information regarding rental or sales of Waikiki Banyan units. The Association has no contact person for such information.

However, if you contemplate renting online, we may be able to help you avoid being scammed by verifying the information you receive.

Check one of our in-house agents or the local media for information on available units.
